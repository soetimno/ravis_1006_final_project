**Milestone 1**

I am currently considering the following paper: "Titling community land to prevent deforestation: An evaluation
of a best-case program in Morona-Santiago, Ecuador" by Butaine, et al.

This is my final project repo:

I like this paper for a couple of reasons. First, I have a background, and likely future, in development. Because of this, I am interested in learning more about program / impact evaluation. Second, I have a background in GIS and spatial analysis that I would like to strengthen with a better understanding of causal/predictive modeling. One of the inputs into this model, which evaluates the effects of a land-titling program on deforestation, is the well-known Hansen, et al dataset of global forest cover. They conducted a GIS-based analysis to produce a panel of forest loss, converted this into a CSV format (at least, in the replication data it's in this format) and then evaluated the program with a difference-in-difference OLS.
